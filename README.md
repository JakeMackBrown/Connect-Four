# Connect Four 

A classic strategy game in which two players go head-to-head in a battle to own the grid.  They drop the discs into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack their colored discs upwards, horizontally, or diagonally. Use strategy to block opponents while aiming to be the first player to get four in a row to win.
