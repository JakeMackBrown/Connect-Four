# Every-Pawn-is-a-Potential-King---Checkers
Checkers (American English), also known as draughts ((/drɑːfts, dræfts/; British English): a board game consisting of twelve pieces on each side advancing a piece diagonally forward to an adjoining square, the goal being to jump and thus capture each of an opponent's pieces until all are removed and victory is declared.

Rules:
1.) The checker board consists of 64 alternating light and dark squares in an 8x8 grid. 
2.) Each player begins with twelve pieces.
3.) Player turns alternate.  There are regular moves and capture moves. 
  - In a regular move, a piece moves forward diagonally to an adjacent empty square.
  - In a capture move, a piece can jump over and capture an opponent’s piece and land on an empty square (landing on a square that is not empty is not allowed).  The jump must be in the forward diagonal direction for pawns, and consecutive jumps are allowed only if they also move forward.
4.) Once a piece (pawn) reaches the row on the opposite end of the board, it becomes a king.  A king must also move diagonally, but can move forwards or backwards, and consecutive jumps are allowed whether they are forward or backward.
5.) If a player has no legal move to take, his/her turn will be forfeited.  If the other player has more pieces, the other player wins.  If the other player has an equal amount or fewer pieces, they will make the next move.
6.) A draw can be offered at any time.  If the other player accepts, the game is over by draw.
